# ray_otami

a pure raymarcher that uses PBR stuff to make nice looking images,  
the scene can be edited in shapes.ron without needing a recompile using a bespoke file format called ron (json but rust)

## how to run
`cargo run --release`

or if you want to attach a debugger and are fine with a 4x slowdown

`cargo run`
